# Two Sum Problem Solution in C++

## Description
This repository contains a C++ solution to the classic "Two Sum" problem, where the goal is to find two indices in a given array of integers that sum up to a specific target value. The solution uses an unordered map to achieve an efficient time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for handling large input sizes within the problem's constraints.

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. The output can be returned in any order.

### Example:
- **Input:** `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
- **Output:** `[0, 1]`

### Repository Contents:
- `two_sum_solution.cpp`: The main C++ file containing the implementation of the solution.
- Sample inputs and outputs to demonstrate the functionality of the code.

## Usage
To run the solution, you can compile the `two_sum_solution.cpp` file using a C++ compiler and execute the resulting binary.

```bash
g++ two_sum_solution.cpp -o two_sum_solution
./two_sum_solution
```
